Steps

1. Create the repository named 'sandbox' on github using my personal account. Done.
2. pull it to my local machine. Done.
3. Create a new branch named 'newmaster'. Done.
4. Make one new commit on it.
5. Switch back to master. Make one new commit there.
6. Push all local commits to github.
7. Change default github branch to 'newmaster'
8. Rename branch 'master' to 'legacy_master' both locally and on github  https://gist.github.com/lttlrck/9628955
9. Rename branch 'newmaster' to 'master' both locally and on github

all other edits will continue on new master branch.
this one will not be used after commiting this edit.
